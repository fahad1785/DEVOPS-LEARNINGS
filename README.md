# DEVOPS-LEARNINGS
I am Fahad Syed a B.Tech graduate and an Ex. TCS'er with an experience of 1.4 years. I have learned DEVOPS and here I will share my learnings.
I have worked in TCS as an Associate System Engineer and got to work on Openshift, Jenkins, and RHEL Servers.

In TCS I realized that I was not getting the work that I am passionate about, that is DevOps.
Although I was doing some backend checks on open shift and some basic stuff on Jenkins, I wanted to learn more but it was not possible in TCS. As the processes were predefined I had to do the same work day by day.

Even though I persisted and started to do some hands-on labs and many more video lessons for DEVOPS.
I  decided to leave TCS and search for a DevOps Role. 

Here I will share my learnings day by day and will make more repos of different DevOps tools.
I will put the projects as well that Iam doing while doing the hands on.
